**A plugin loader example program in kotlin-jvm**

dont worry, theres no java. I copy pasted a game I made to use as an example plugin.

it can also load from local or over the internet. so thats kinda cool.

I learned to use a profiler and found out that **IT STILL DOES NOT UNLOAD APPARENTLY** 

(yes even if theres no minesweeper in the plugins jar and only the 2 super basic ones.)

**HELP** Im pretty stuck at this point. I dont see any more references to remove....
