**A plugin loader example program in kotlin-jvm**

**THIS PLUGIN LOADER IS NOT YET VERY GOOD. IT CANNOT YET RELIABLY CLOSE THE PLUGINS IT CREATES, although I am trying**

it can however load from local or over the internet. so thats kinda cool.

[examplepluginloader.PluggerXP.PluginLoader](examplepluginloader/src/main/kotlin/examplepluginloader/PluggerXP/PluginLoader.kt)

The plan. Make PluginClassLoader and MySystemLoader as described in the comments within them
